    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            This spicy Malabar stuffed chicken aka kozhi nirachathu will surely surprise you.<br>
            Even though you’re removing the skin of the chicken, it’ll stay super moist. Awesome, right?
        </p>
        <p>
            The stuffing includes hardboiled egg and spicy masala. The masala is a combination of few<br>
            common spices mixed with onions. It’s also important to shallow fry the chicken before it goes<br>
            into the oven.
