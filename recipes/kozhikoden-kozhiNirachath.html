        <p>
            This spicy Malabar stuffed chicken aka kozhi nirachathu will surely surprise you.<br>

            The stuffing includes hardboiled egg and spicy masala. The masala is a combination of few<br>
            common spices mixed with onions. It’s also important to shallow fry the chicken before it goes<br>
            into the oven.
