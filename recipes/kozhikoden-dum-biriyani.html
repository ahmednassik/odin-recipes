            <h2>Description</h2>

                <p>
                    Biryani is the rich and royal dish that can instantly make your menu drool-worthy.<br>
                    A rice based dish, the only one that would always be the main dish even in an elaborate,<br>
                    exquisite lunch or dinner menu. Biryani has its origin in the Muslim community, the Mughlai<br>
                    and the Awadhi cuisine but with time it has crossed borders and is now a popular dish across<br>
                    nations with different variations for different palates. This biryani recipe here is a popular<br>
                    one from Kerala which has two distinct biryanis, the other one apart from this is the Thalassery biryani<br>
                    which has just a slightly different method from this one.
