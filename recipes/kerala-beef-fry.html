    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Kerala, my hometown is quite famous for its natural beauty, greenery, backwaters… 
        and also for its food!!<br> Its culinary is known for its vegetarian 
        and non-vegetarian dishes alike, but the sea food and beef recipes 
        stand out,<br> both among the natives and the tourists who visit the state
    </p>
    <p>
        Unlike the usual curry form, beef is best savored among Malayalees in a fry 
        or roast (ularthiyathu) preparation.<br>The country style beef roast, cooked 
        in iron pans with a lot of curry leaves bring out a unique flavour and aroma
        which tastes beyond words!<br>The best combination with beef roast is a side of
        Kerala Porottas; a layered flat bread made with flour.<br>Beef dishes with porotta
        are very popular among the street foods of Kerala; it is such an exquisite dish
        that, be it a road side stall or a star hotel, you will find the same love and
        authenticity given to its preparation.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2½ lb beef</li>
        <li>25 shallots (thinly sliced)</li>
        <li>2-3 green chilies (slit)</li>
        <li>1 tbsp ginger garlic paste</li>
        <li>¼ tbsp turmeric powder</li>
        <li>1 tbsp red chili powder</li>
        <li>1½ tbsp coriander powder</li>
        <li>2 tbsp pepper powder</li>
        <li>1 tsp meat masala</li>
        <li>½ tsp garam masala</li>
        <li>4-6 sprigs curry leaves</li>
        <li>¼ cup coconut bites</li>
        <li>a pinch of mustard seeds</li>
        <li>salt (as required)</li>
        <li>oil (as required)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Clean and cut beef into cube shaped pieces (preferably soup cut).</li>
        <li>Cook the beef in a pressure cooker with salt, pepper powder, meat masala, and a little water just enough to cover the meat. Pressure cook for 2 whistles and then remove the cooker from the flame. Allow it to rest until the pressure goes off. Keep aside.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a pan and splutter mustard seeds. Add curry leaves, sliced shallots, green chilies, and a little salt. Saute until the onions turn translucent.</li>
        <li>Add ginger garlic paste, saute for a minute until the smell resides.</li>
        <li>Add spice powders; chili, coriander, turmeric, garam masala, and mix well. Make sure to turn the heat to a low while adding the spice powders, so that it does not burn.</li>
        <li>Remove the lid from the pressure cooker and transfer the cooked beef with the remaining water to the pan, mix well with the masala and cook on a medium flame until the gravy dries out. Stir the gravy occasionally while cooking, to prevent it from sticking to the bottom of the pan. Add salt as needed.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, heat a little oil in another pan and fry the coconut bites. As it starts to brown, add curry leaves and fry it along with the coconut bites until browned. Keep aside.</li>
        <li>When the gravy dries out, reduce the flame to a low and saute the beef in the pan for 10-15 minutes. Add the fried curry leaves and coconut bites, and mix well together. Scrape the sides of the pan, toss until the meat is brown -black and dried out completely.</li>
        <li>Serve hot with Rice, Porotta, Appam, Naan, or any other bread.</li>
